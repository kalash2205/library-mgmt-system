# library-mgmt-system

An entirely C project. 
This library management system consists of a text file holding records of all books available in the library with a status of whether is it available to borrow or not and if it is borrowed then it shows the borrowers' name.
It also gives users a functionality to search, issue and return books.
Users can also re-issue a book before the due date ends.
It will calculate the fine(if any) for borrowers if they do not return the book before the due date.
The manager can add new books and delete any book.
